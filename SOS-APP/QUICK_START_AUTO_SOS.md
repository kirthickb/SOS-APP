# Quick Start Guide - Automatic SOS Features

## What Was Implemented

Two automatic SOS triggering mechanisms have been added to your SOS Ambulance app:

### 1. 🎤 Voice SOS

- Listen for emergency keywords: "help", "emergency", "108", "accident"
- Automatically trigger SOS when keyword detected
- 30-second cooldown between triggers

### 2. 🚗 Driving Mode (ML Crash Detection)

- Real-time crash detection using Machine Learning (Isolation Forest)
- Monitors GPS speed and accelerometer data
- Triggers SOS if crash pattern detected with high confidence

---

## How to Use

### Enable Features in App

1. Open `ClientHomeScreen`
2. Scroll down to "Automatic SOS Triggers" section
3. Toggle on:
   - **🎤 Voice SOS** - Enable voice keyword detection
   - **🚗 Driving Mode** - Enable ML crash detection

### Voice SOS

**When enabled:**

- App listens continuously for speech
- If you say any of these keywords, SOS automatically triggers:
  - "help"
  - "emergency"
  - "108" (emergency number in India)
  - "accident"

**Status indicator:** Shows 🔴 Listening when active

**Example:** "I need help!" → SOS sent automatically

### Driving Mode (ML Crash Detection)

**When enabled:**

- App samples your speed and acceleration every second
- Uses machine learning to detect abnormal patterns
- If crash-like pattern detected:
  - Verification window opens (5 seconds)
  - Monitors for consistent anomalies
  - If confirmed + low speed detected → SOS triggered

**Status indicator:**

- Shows "Monitoring (Score: 0.523)" in real-time
- Shows ⚠️ Anomaly verification when detecting crash pattern

**What triggers SOS:**

- Sudden hard braking/acceleration + low final speed
- Erratic motion patterns + stop
- NOT triggered by: normal driving, smooth curves, smooth acceleration

## Key Features

✅ **No Backend Changes** - Uses existing SOS API  
✅ **No Navigation Changes** - Same SOS flow as manual trigger  
✅ **Independent Features** - Can enable either or both  
✅ **Safe Defaults** - Cooldowns and verification prevent false positives  
✅ **Console Logging** - Full debug logs showing what's happening

## Real-Time Console Output

### Voice SOS

```
🎤 [VoiceSOSService] Starting voice listener...
🎤 [VoiceSOSService] Recognized transcript: help me
🎤 [VoiceSOSService] Keyword detected: "help"
🎤 [VoiceSOSService] Triggering SOS for keyword: help
```

### ML Crash Detection

```
🚗 [CrashMLService] Speed: 45.23m/s | Motion: 2.15 | ΔSpeed: 0.12m/s² | Score: 0.523
⚠️ [CrashMLService] Anomaly detected! Score: 0.78 (threshold: 0.7)
📊 [CrashMLService] Starting 5-second verification window...
🚨 [CrashMLService] CRASH DETECTED! Multiple anomalies + low speed
```

### Auto SOS Trigger

```
🚨 [AutoSOS] Triggering SOS from source: VOICE
📍 [AutoSOS] Getting current location...
✅ [AutoSOS] SOS created successfully! ID: 12345
```

## Testing the Features

### Test Voice SOS

1. Enable "🎤 Voice SOS" toggle
2. Look at console logs (should show "Listening...")
3. Speak a keyword: "Help!", "Emergency!", "Accident!"
4. SOS should trigger automatically
5. Check console for trigger confirmation

### Test Driving Mode

1. Enable "🚗 Driving Mode" toggle
2. Watch the anomaly score update in real-time
3. Normal driving: Score stays ~0.4-0.5
4. Sudden acceleration/braking: Score jumps above 0.7
5. If sustained + speed drops → SOS triggered
6. Check console for detailed logs

### Test Both Together

1. Enable both toggles
2. Either trigger should work independently
3. Triggering one doesn't affect the other

---

## Configuration

### Adjust Voice Keywords

Edit `app/services/voiceSOS.ts`:

```typescript
keywords: ["help", "emergency", "108", "accident"]; // Change these
cooldownSeconds: 30; // Cooldown between triggers
```

### Adjust ML Sensitivity

Edit `app/services/crashMLService.ts`:

```typescript
anomalyScoreThreshold: 0.7,           // Higher = less sensitive
verificationDurationSeconds: 5,        // How long to verify
minSpeedForCrashDetection: 2,         // Only detect when moving
```

## Dependencies

Already installed:

- ✅ `expo-location` - GPS
- ✅ `expo-sensors` - Accelerometer

Optional (for production):

- 🔧 `expo-speech-recognition` - For real voice recognition
  - Currently there's a placeholder, ready for integration

---

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Permissions Required:**

- Location permission - for GPS coordinates
- Accelerometer access - for motion detection
- Microphone - for voice (when integrating real speech recognition)

⚠️ **Battery Impact:**

- Voice SOS: Minimal when disabled, moderate when enabled
- Driving Mode: ~5-10% CPU increase when enabled
- Disable when not needed to save battery

⚠️ **False Positive Prevention:**

- Voice: 30-second cooldown prevents accidental repeated triggers
- ML: 5-second verification window + speed threshold prevents false crash detection
- Both: User can always cancel SOS manually

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the UI**: Enable/disable toggles in ClientHomeScreen
2. **Monitor console**: Watch logs showing the features in action
3. **Integrate real voice recognition**: Replace placeholder in `voiceSOS.ts` with `expo-speech-recognition`
4. **Collect training data**: Record real driving for better ML model
5. **User feedback**: Test with actual users for refinement

---

## Troubleshooting

**Voice SOS not triggering?**

- Check console for "Listening..." message
- Verify keyword spoken clearly
- Check cooldown isn't preventing trigger (wait 30 seconds)
- Ensure location permission granted

**Driving Mode not working?**

- Check console for GPS/accelerometer errors
- Verify moving faster than 2 m/s
- Check anomaly score updates in real-time
- Ensure location permission granted

**SOS not sending?**

- Check network connection
- Verify location permission
- Check API backend is running
- Look for error messages in console
